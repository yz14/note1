\section{Escaping saddle points} 

This lecture formalizes and shows the following intuitive statement for
nonconvex optimization:
\begin{center}
	\textbf{Gradient descent almost never converges to (strict) saddle points.}
\end{center}
The result was shown in~\cite{lee2016gradient}. Let's start with some definitions.

\begin{definition}[Stationary point]
We call $x^*$ a stationary point if the gradient vanishes at $x^*,$ i.e., 
$\nabla f(x^*) = 0$. 
\end{definition}

We can further classify stationary points into different categories. One
important category are saddle points.

\begin{definition}[Saddle point]
A stationary point $x^*$ is a \emph{saddle point} 
if for all $\epsilon>0$,  there are points $x,y \in B(x^*;\epsilon)$ 
s.t.~$f(x)\leq f(x^*)\leq f(y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Strict saddle point]
For a twice continuously differentiable function $f\in C^2$, a saddle point
$x^*$ is a \emph{strict saddle point} if the Hessian at that point is not
positive semidefinite, i.e.  $\lambda_{\text{min}}(\nabla^2 f(x^*)) < 0$, where
$\lambda_{\text{min}}$ denotes the smallest eigenvalue.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Dynamical systems perspective}

It'll be helpful to think of the trajectory defined by gradient descent as a
dynamical system.
To do so, we view each gradient descent update as a operator.  
For a fixed step size $\eta$, let
$$
g(x) = x-\eta\nabla f(x)
$$ 
so the notation for the result of iteration $t$ from our previous discussion of gradient descent carries over as $x_t = g^t(x_0) = g(g(...g(x_0)))$, where $g$ is applied $t$ times on the initial point $x_0$. We call $g$ the gradient map. Note that $x^*$ is stationary iff. it is a fixed point of the gradient map i.e. $g(x^*) = x^*$. Also note that
$D g(x) = I - \eta\nabla^2 f(x)$ (Jacobian of $g$) , a fact that will become important later. Now we formalize a notion of the set of "attractors`` of $x^*$.
\begin{definition}
The global stable set of $x^*$, is defined as
$$
W^S(x^*) = \{ x\in\R^n: \lim_{t} g^t(x) = x^* \}
$$
In words, this is the set of points that will eventually converge to $x^*$.
\end{definition}

With this definition out of the way, we can state the main claim formally as
follows.

\begin{theorem}
\theoremlabel{lecture18-main}
Assume $f\in C^2$ and is $\beta$-smooth. Also assume that the step size $\eta <
1/\beta$. Then for all strict saddle points $x^*$, its set of attractors
$W^S(x^*)$ has Lebesgue measure $0$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
In fact, it could be proven with additional technicalities that the Lebesgue measure of 
$
\bigcup_{\text{strict saddle points }x^*} W^S(x^*)
$
is also 0. This is just another way to say that gradient descent almost surely converges to local minima. 
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
By definition, this also holds true to any probability measure absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure (e.g. any continuous probability distribution). That is,
$$\mathbb{P}(\lim_t x_t = x^*) = 0$$
\end{remark}

However, the theorem above is only an asymptotic statement. Non-asymptotically, even with fairly natural random initialization schemes and non-pathological functions, gradient descent can be significantly slowed down by saddle points. 
The most recent result \cite{du2017gradient} is that gradient descent takes exponential time to escape saddle points (even though the theorem above says that they do escape eventually). We won't prove this result in this lecture.

\subsection{The case of quadratics}
Before the proof, let's go over two examples that will make the proof more intuitive:

\begin{example}
$f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^THx$ where $H$ is an $n$-by-$n$ matrix, symmetric but not positive semidefinite. 
For convenience, assume $0$ is not an eigenvalue of $H$.
So $0$ is the only stationary point and the only strict saddle point for this problem.

We can calculate
$g(x) = x - \eta Hx = (I-\eta H)x$ and 
$g^t(x) = (I-\eta H)^tx$. 
And we know that 
$\lambda_i(I - \eta H) = 
1-\eta \lambda_i(H)$, where $\lambda_i$ for $i=1...n$ could denote any one of the eigenvalues.
So in order for $\lim_t g^t(x) = \lim_t (1-\eta \lambda_i(H))^t x$ to converge to 0, we just need $\lim_t (1-\eta \lambda_i(H))^t$ to converge to 0, that is, $|1-\eta \lambda_i(H)| < 1$. This implies that
$$W^S(0) = \text{span}\bigg\{ u| Hu=\lambda u,  0< \lambda < \frac{\eta}{2} \bigg\}$$
i.e. the set of eigenvectors for the positive eigenvalues smaller than 
$\frac{\eta}{2}$. Since $\eta$ can be arbitrarily large, we just consider the larger set of eigenvectors for the positive eigenvalues. By our assumption on $H$, this set has dimension lower than $n$, thus has measure 0.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Consider the function 
$f(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{4}y^4 - \frac{1}{2}y^2$  with corresponding
gradient update 
\[
g(x,y) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
(1-\eta)x\\
(1+\eta)y - \eta y^3 
\end{bmatrix}\,,
\]
and Hessian
\[
\nabla^2 f(x,y) = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 3y^2-1 \\
\end{bmatrix}\,.
\]
We can see that $(0,-1)$ and $(0,1)$ are the local minima, and $(0,0)$ is the only strict saddle point. Similar to in the previous example, $W^S(0)$ is a low-dimensional subspace. 

\subsection{The general case}

We conclude this lecture with a proof of the main theorem.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \theoremref{lecture18-main}]
First define the local stable set of $x^*$ as
$$
W^S_\epsilon(x^*) 
= \{ x\in B(x^*;\epsilon): g^t(x)\in B(x^*;\epsilon) ~\forall t \}
$$
Intuitively, this describes the subset of $B(x^*;\epsilon)$ that stays in $B(x^*;\epsilon)$ under arbitrarily many gradient maps. This establishes a notion of locality that matters for gradient descent convergence, instead of $B(x^*;\epsilon)$ which has positive measure.

Now we state a simplified version of the stable manifold theorem without proof: For a diffeomorphism $g:\R^n\rightarrow\R^n$, if $x^*$ is a fixed point of $g$, then for all $\epsilon$ small enough, $W^S_\epsilon(x^*)$ is a submanifold of dimension equal to the number of eigenvalues of the $Dg(x^*)$ that are $\leq 1$. A diffeomorphism, roughly speaking, is a differentiable isomorphism. In fact, since differentiability is assumed for $g$, we will focus on the isomorphism.

Let $x^*$ be a strict saddle point.
Once we have proven the fact that $g$ is a diffeomorphism (using the assumption that $\eta<1/\beta$), we can apply the stable manifold theorem since $x^*$ is a fixed point of $g$. 
Because $\nabla^f (x^*)$ must have an eigenvalue $<0$, $Dg$ must have an eigenvalue $>1$, so 
the dimension of $W^S_\epsilon(x^*)$ is less than $n$ and $W^S_\epsilon(x^*)$ has measure 0. 

If $g^t(x)$ converges $x^*$, there must $\exists T$ large enough s.t. $g^T(x)\in W_\epsilon^S(x^*)$. 
So $W^S(x^*)\subseteq \bigcup_{t\geq 0 }g^{-t}(W_\epsilon^S(x^*))$.
For each $t$, $g^t$ is in particular an isomorphism (as a composition of isomorphisms), and so it $g^{-t}$.
Therefore $g^{-t}(W_\epsilon^S(x^*))$ has the same cardinality as 
$W_\epsilon^S(x^*)$ and has measure 0. Because the union is over a countable set, the union also has measure 0, thus its subset $W^S(x^*)$ ends up with measure 0 and we have the desired result.

Finally we show that $g$ is bijective to establish the isomorphism (since it is assumed to be smooth). It is injective because, assuming $g(x) = g(y)$, by smoothness,
$$
\|x-y\| = \|g(x) + \eta\nabla f(x) - g(y) - \eta\nabla f(x) \|
 = \eta\|\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y)\|\leq \eta\beta\|x-y\|
$$
Because $\eta\beta < 1$, we must have $\|x-y\|=0$.
To prove that $g$ is surjective, we construct an inverse function
$$h(y) = \argmin_x \frac{1}{2}\|x-y\|^2 - \eta f(x)$$
a.k.a. the proximal update. For $\eta < 1/\beta$, $h$ is strongly convex, and by the KKT condition,
$y = h(y) - \nabla f(h(y)) = g(h(y))$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\end{example}
